# DeepStares' Sonic.exe/Creepypastas Modpack

Hello there! This is a "high effort" (only coding wise, I don't really use that many custom sprites) compilation of some Sonic.exe/Creepypastas related levels neatly packed inside a mod folder!

## Features...(?)

So far I've finished porting the following:
* Hog:
    * Hedge
    * Manual Blast
* X-terion:
    * Substantial

All of these levels come with optimized sprites and other stuff that **SHOULD** make the RAM usage not as intensive as the OG versions.
For example: Manual Blast could've taken more than 1.4GB of RAM easily but it only takes an average of 800mb...and 1 GB at max

## Instalation

First of all, download [Psych Engine](https://gamebanana.com/mods/309789)

**IF YOU WANT IT TO AUTOMATICALLY UPDATE**:
1. Download GitHub Desktop
2. Do whatever you need to with the tutorial or whatever (or if you can, skip it)
3. Go to *File -> Clone Repository -> Paste the URL of this github -> And in Local Path choose your mods folder, it should look something like "PsychEngine\mods\SonicCreepyBundle"*
4. It should download the pack now automatically!
- **NOTE:** Whenever you want to update it to the latest version, you should just click on the "Fetch Origin" button

**IF YOU INSTEAD WANT TO MANUALLY UPDATE IT (Not so recommended bc it gets kinda tiring)**
1. On this page, click on "code" and Download as Zip.
2. Just extract it into your mods folder and you're done... *yay...*


## To-do list:

Well, since this is completely a for-fun project, it may or may not take a while to fulfill these, but still.
- [ ] Re-add and optimize more the ones left in my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYFaFqDCd6TaKpSbYDDaH5A)
- [ ] More new songs! (duh)
- [ ] Aaaand, a working custom menu! (Still too lazy to code that in yet)

## Finally...

If there are issues, make sure to notify me either from here, or from the corresponging video in my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYFaFqDCd6TaKpSbYDDaH5A)

Have fun!
